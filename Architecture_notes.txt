************* UI and index.html ****************

* the html code in index.html is run only the first time, and in the next game levels, it won't get re-created. 
Because everytime we start a new game/level:

game.state.start('Game1');

it will run the three built-in funcitons: preload(), create(), and update() for that state e.g. Game1. So the html in index.html stayes
intact, and therefore all the top header components won't get re-created. In other words, when phaser start a game, it starts by running
index.html, and then the js file is embedded at the end of the index file, so it starts running all the phaser js files afterwards. And in 
each game leve, we just run the three functions belong to the game.state that we select.

* you still can change the value of the top html components in every game in the create() and update() funcitons, but keep this in mind,
 if you generate an html element and append to the index.html elements, your element stays there for all game.states, because the html in
 index.html doesn't change, and whatever changes you add to it, it will keep it thorught the levels.

* the UI for the start menu and game-over interface are created in create() funciton as sprites and images, we don't create their UIs in index.html or
any html file.
