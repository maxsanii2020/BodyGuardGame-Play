* Image:
1. Crop the images, usually to remove the bullet, but you can remove the back and front size.
	- In GIMP, select the size and remember the width number, then click on crop.
	(it's better to not crop walk images, cause it will damage the harmony of walking when you cut it, it won't look nice in animation)
	(only crop the images of shooting)
	

2. If the image had an shadow, remove it:
	- In GIMP, select the free tool(third icon on the left), and draw around the shadow, and then press "Delete", and then "CTR+Shift+A"

3. resize the image to .22 percent, and export it.

* TexturePacker:
- set the options according to the image
- Select one Idle image and put it as the first image, by changing its file name
- Select the walk and attack images

- Data Format -> Phaser(JSONHash)
- Texture Format -> PNG-8(Indexed)
- Max size -> 8192 x 2048(or higher)
- uncheck "Multipack"


* Code:
- In Index.js, add the spritesheet file (one line)
- In SpriteConfig.cs, add a new case statement for two Switch statements:
	- find the bulletPosition
	- set the default frame, it's based on the order that you put the images in TextPacker.
	- set the walk and attack animations, based on the json file, look at the file name you will figure out how to do it.
	(name the number of the images from 000, if not it will send an error)
	E.G:
        this.sprite.animations.add('walk', Phaser.Animation.generateFrameNames('maskbandit_Walk_', 0, 7, '.png', 3), 12, true,false);
	- there are 8 images starting from 000 to 007



- in game_config.js, create a new entry for this charactor.

(that's it, you don't have to do anything to the code that creates and populates characters, it works dynamically based on character array
that you already changed in the last part.)



****************** Tips on editing images/spritesheets *********************

- make sure the name of the spritehseet.json matches with the name pre-text for Walk and Attack (look for capital letters, it matters!)

- make sure that the name of the images start with 000, not 001, that way when you put the range in the code, you can put 0 to something.
